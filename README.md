## Overview:

This project involves the creation of a program to help the producers of the popular TV series "Wednesday" organize their upcoming season's filming in Romania.
The program will manage project scheduling, filming logistics, and budgets.

## Features:

  * Cast and Crew Management: The program will parse a CSV file containing the names and roles of cast members. Additionally, it will generate 132 extras randomly for filming.
  Transportation Planning: Calculates the number of buses needed to transport all personnel from the airport to Cantacuzino Castle. Each bus has a capacity of 50 people, and the rental cost per bus is provided.
    
  * Makeup Costs: Assigns each cast  member to one of five monster types, each with specific makeup costs per filming day.
  Meal Planning: Generates a 3-day menu for lunch breaks, considering dietary preferences (omnivore, vegetarian, flexitarian) and associated costs.
  
  * Accommodation: Books hotel rooms for cast and extras based on room sizes and costs per night.
  Water and Beverage Management: Calculates daily water, coffee, and juice consumption per person and associated costs.
  
  * Location Rental: Calculates the daily rental cost for Cantacuzino Castle, considering potential discounts based on the duration of filming.
  Cost Projection: Estimates the total cost of filming for various durations (30, 45, 60, 100 days) in dollars.
  
  * Multi-Language Support: Generates CSV files in both English and Romanian for ease of understanding and accessibility.

## Objectives:

  * Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including classes, constructors, destructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, templates, and exceptions.
  * Ensure code readability, style, structure, and documentation.
  * Validate OOP concepts through implementation and explanation in the final presentation.
